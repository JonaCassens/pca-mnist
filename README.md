# pca-mnist
Investigates the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. This notebook applies PCA to compute principal components, reconstructs images from reduced features, and evaluates the resulting trade-off between neural network training time and classification accuracy.
